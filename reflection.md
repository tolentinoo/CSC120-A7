Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.
- I used the non-penalty extension on A6 but forgot to put in the extension.txt file explaining that I'm using 
    the extension you gave us. Worked with Gracia B and Laisha 
- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
    Cafe Class:
    I overloaded the restock methods. By overloading the restock method I'm able to only retock certain products in the cafe. In the first restock method I overloaded I chose to only restock nCoffeeOunces,nSugarPackets and nCreams. In the second restock method I overloaded I chose to only restock the nCofeeOunces and nSugarPackets. 

    Library Class:
    For the Library Class I chose to overload the contructor. I gave the constructor for library default values in case the user only inputs the name of the library. I overloaded the isAvailable method. The overloaded version of the isAvailable method takes in the title of the book and the name of the library. First it checks if the user is searching in the right library then it checks if that book is aviable at the library they're lookin in.

    House Class:
    For the House Class I chose to overload the moveIn method. By overloading the moveIn method I allowed residents to be added to the residents arraylist using their name and smith ID number. Additionally, I overloaded the moveOut method to reflect the changes I made. Now the moveOut method allows residents to be removed from the residents arraylist using their smith ID number and name. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
 I would tell the student to begin their homework assingment a few days earlier than anticipated due to the fact that I underestimated the amount of time I spent on it. I would recommend the student to fix their A6 assignment since this assigments build onto that previous assingment. Then I would recommend them to review the slides of the lecture related to this assignment because I had a lot of questions come up about inheritance, overriding and overloading when I was doing this assingment. I would definintely tell them to go to office hours to get their questions clarified.
